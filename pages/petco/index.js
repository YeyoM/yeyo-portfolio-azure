            Cool stuff I got from Petco
          </p>
          <p className="text-md font-normal text-black text-justify mt-4">
            My time at Petco has been an incredible opportunity to grow as an
            engineer and as a professional. The 11 months I spent being an intern 
            in the SRE team has equipped me with a really solid foundation in 
            many technologies and practices that are required in this field. I 
            got the opportunity to have a glance of how a large-scale enterprise 
            operates both cloud and on-premises infrastructure, and how to 
            maintain and improve it. Apert from the technical skills, I also 
            learned how teams work together to solve complex problems, how 
            communication is one of the biggest parts when it comes to  
            improving the reliability of a system, and how to adapt to 
            different situations and new challenges that arise in this industry. 
          </p>
          <p className="text-md font-normal text-black text-justify mt-4">
            And now that I have started my new position as a full-time SRE at Petco, 
            I am really excited to continue my journey in this field and to keep 
            learning, growing and contributing to the team. I am looking forward 
            to continue working in really cool projects and improving the life of 
            our customers and their pets through technology.
